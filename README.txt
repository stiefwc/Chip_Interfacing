ECE387 Basic Chip/Peripheral Interfacing

For the basic chip project, I interfaced with the BYJ48 Stepper Motor and ULN2003 Driver board. I decided to make a panoramic camera head which can be used for time lapses or panoramic photos. The C code is modular and allows the user to alter three variables which decide the degrees of rotation, the total time in minutes of the rotation, and the direction of the rotation (clockwise and counterclockwise).

Here is a video demonstration:
